	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
	<p style="color:black;font-size: 18px">We found the implementation of game logic to be much more difficult than
		anticipated. For
		example, we had planned to implement the game in a fully tile-based manner, but quickly realized that in order
		for the charactersâ€™ movement on the VGA display to appear smooth enough they could not jump from one tile to the
		next, thus we also needed some extent of control between tiles. We also did not anticipate how many corner cases
		we would have to deal with throughout the game logic. Instead, we had predicted running into issues with running
		out of space on the Pico either as far as storing designs and sound effects or for running the game code.
		Neither of these issues ended up being a problem. While we did not end up scaling the project back in any
		significant way from our expected result, there are a couple minor bugs as a result of corner cases which we did
		not discover with enough time to fully resolve. A result of things being more difficult than expected is that we
		did not spend as much time iterating on level design as we had anticipated, thus we did not stray from the
		original game as much as we potentially would have if we had found ourselves with extra time near the end of the
		project.
	</p>

	<p style="color:black;font-size: 18px">As a result of developing the game program from very strong fundamentals and
		prioritizing
		organization and good coding practices, we were able to add features like interactable, additional enemies, and
		walking animation frames for the main character more easily than could have been if we had taken a more
		short-term approach to the game engine development. Specifically, we implemented the puzzle and the villager
		with whom the player must interact within the last few days of the project.
	</p>

	<p style="color:black;font-size: 18px">While the sound effects for the game feel complete with respect to a final
		project, plenty of
		work could be done to add sound functionality or clean up our current selections. Because we used less than half
		of the available flash space on the RP2040 in our current implementation, we could remaster this with a higher
		sampling frequency and better recording technology. One major constraint we faced with sound effects is that
		only one effect could be played at any given time. To fix this, we could develop a PIO program to average the
		sequencing of two DMA channels to be sent to the DAC. Because the background music is critically space
		constrained, we could expand our current music selection to include different songs for different locations
		in-game, or we could add new music parts to better match the sound generation of a true video game console.
	</p>

	<p style="color:black;font-size: 18px">As far as intellectual property, we set out to design a Zelda-like game so
		there would obviously exist some conflict if we were to attempt to profit off this game, for example. All designs used in
		the game were ultimately designed by us, but many are heavily inspired by either the original Zelda game or
		other video games like Pokemon and Minecraft. Since the intention of this project was to create a game that
		would be fun for us and others in the class, etc to play and challenge ourselves to implement many of the
		features of a well-known game rather than to take credit for the creation of any aspect of the game idea itself
		we do not believe there is any harm being done. Furthermore, our 9-level demo level, while potentially
		impressive for a 4-week project completed by undergraduates, does not come close to the original game in quality
		or scope.

			<p>The Legend of Zelda is action and adventure video game, published by Nintendo, that originated in Japan
				on the Family Computer Disk System in 1986. Now, there are over 20 subsequent official versions of the game.
				This project is our attempt to recreate the original to see what challenges the original gamemakers faced, while
				still taking our own creative liberties. Our design includes the use of the Raspberry Pi Pico as the core
				processing unit, as well as the use of a VGA screen for the display, a keyboard for user input, and sound ouput
				through a set of desktop speakers. While our implementation is not perfectly true to the original, it undoubtedly
				shows our commitment to a clean, working embedded video game.</p>

	<!-- RESULTS -->
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p style="color:black;"> The results of our project are entirely evaluated by playing the game. The effectiveness of
		the game engine is evaluated based on the “feel” of gameplay: responsiveness, apparent smoothness of animation,
		proper timing, etc. A notable issue we were unable to resolve, mostly due to time constraints, is that the
		characters flickered on the screen when moved. While annoying, we did not think this hindered player experience
		enough to be worth fixing since we did not have a clear, simple solution defined. Otherwise, we were able to
		implement all character movement and interaction with the environment as we had originally planned, mostly based
		on functionality of the original game. Accuracy of sound output is also easy to subjectively evaluate. It is
		very noticeable when things sound incorrect, as we unpleasantly experienced during testing. Fortunately, the
		sound effects and background music in the final game were very pleasant. Visual assets were also subjectively
		evaluated by ourselves. Since we were not expressly held to copying any particular design exactly we could
		essentially make things look however we wanted. Even so, we are a bit of perfectionists so this involved a lot
		of iteration, modifying designs, and testing on the VGA display.
